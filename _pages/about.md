I have graduated from [The University of Science, VNU-HCM](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn/), with a Bachelor of Science in Advanced Program in Computer Science. I was fortunate to be supervised by [Professor Vu Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NNZVGIcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Long HB Nguen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jECXavQAAAAJ&hl=en) during my undergraduate studies. Besides that, I work as undergraduate research assistant at the [Computational Linguistics Center](https://www.clc.hcmus.edu.vn/), and later joined [Katalon](https://katalon.com) as an AI/Software Research Intern, where I had a truly memorable time there. Currently, I am an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s student, fully funded by the Erasmus Mundus Scholarship, pursuing the [EDISS](https://www.master-ediss.eu) program, with my first year based in Finland

I am interested in Natural Language Processing and its applications in Software Engineering and Robotics to improve people’s lives. For example, I want to explore how to create a useful personal agent that can support software engineers or even assist in everyday life.
<!-- I am interested in Natural Language Processing, including (but not limited to):
- **Language Model-related Problems**: Natural language understanding, logical reasoning, hallucination, knowledge integration, trustworthiness, and robustness.
- **Applications of Language Models**: Using language models for domain-specific problems, real-world problems, or various NLP downstream tasks, such as information retrieval, question-answering, summarization, and dialogue systems.
- **Training/Learning Methods**: Learning strategies for improving the performance of LLMs and how to make them think like humans.
- **Vision Language Model**: Multimodal reasoning and understanding. -->


<!-- focuses on the application of large language models to traditional NLP tasks and real-world problems, as well as methods for improving their performance. I also collaborate on projects exploring the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, specifically in the domain of vision-language models. -->
